I have selected advect.m to be modified for this homework.
The goal is to allow this program to run from the command line as a function instead of requesting user inputs for the variables needed.
The modified program will be available as advectMOD2.m on this repository (https://github.com/yorkphall/NM4PMOD/tree/master/MatlabRevised)

Thank you
